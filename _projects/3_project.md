I have been fortunate to be able to travel and I enjoy it so much!
I have visited many places in America and also abroad. I try to go to South Korea every two years to go see my relatives. I will share some of my favorite vacations below.

## Europe 2018
I went to Europe with my family. We first went to London and visited the Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge, and a Tottenham Hospur soccer match. I had a great time shopping on Bond Street and eating foods like fish and chips. The next part of the itinerary was to the capital of France. We visited world-reknowned landmarks like Notre Dame Cathedral, Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and the Arc de Triomphe. We also ate signature foods like escargot and macarons. I had such a great time and hope to go back to these cities again.

## Japan 2018
I took a quick four day stop at Japan before going to South Korea. With one of my closest friends, I went to the cities of Osaka and Kyoto. The two cities have big contrasts and it was nice to experience them both: Osaka is filled with entertainment as Kyoto is a historic city. We went to Osaka Castle, Osaka Aquarium, Nara deer park, Arashimaya bamboo forest, and Fushimi Inari-taisha Shrine. Food was a highlight of the trip as I ate great ramen, sushi, udon, and soba noodles.

## Hawaii 2019
This was a spring break trip with members of a dance crew I was involved in during college. We had a local Hawaiian go with us, so we were able to go to the spots tourists would not know. We snorkeled at shark cove, sun bathed at Waikiki beach, and went hiking. We also went to Dole pineapple farm and ate local foods like pokebowls. This trip made me experience the natural beauties I have never seen before.

## Seattle 2021
I went with a group of high school friends because we had another friend staying there over the summer. We hiked at Mt. Rainier, walked around Pike Place Market, and walked by the Amazon headquarters.

## California 2022
The first stop was to Los Angeles. I went to Universal Studios, Hollywood Walk of Fame, Koreatown, and Santa Monica Beach. I then flew to San Francisco to visit two college friends. We went to the Golden Gate Bridge, Google campus, and by the pier to see wild sea lions.
