## Music
When you see me walking around by myself, I will always see me with airpods on. I enjoy listening to many different types of genres of music like hip-hop/rap, pop, R&B, and K-Pop. My favorite artists are Kendrick Lamar, Khalid, Justin Bieber, Bigbang, and Blackpink. I like how music allows me to embrace the Korean-American cultural dichotomy. I plan on going to a Blackpink concert at Metlife Stadium in August.

## Dance
Back in high school we had an event called Diversity Day. This is when different cultures and ethnicities come out and showcase their dances, foods, and so much more. I was dragged into the Korean dance group. I have never danced before, but I was able to catch on and able to perform all four years in high school. In college, I decided to pursue this hobby by auditioning and joining RICE Crew on campus. It is a dance crew that does hip-hop and K-Pop dances for events on campus and uploads dance cover videos on YouTube. Being a head teacher for the crew was my biggest involvement in college aside from my studies.
