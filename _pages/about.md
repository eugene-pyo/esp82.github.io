Hello. My name is Eugene Pyo and welcome to my personal website in which I share some background information about me and about my educational and professional experience history.

I am currently a graduate student in the M.Eng Financial Engineering program at Cornell University. I have taken interesting courses like Optimization and Investment & Portfolio Management. Prior to attending Cornell, I went to the University of Rochester for undergrad studying Mathematics and Statistics with minors in business and computer science. During my academic career, I have done many cool and technically driven projects like a technical entrepreneurship business plan, valuating NBA free agents, and improving linear regression for portfolio management. 

My career path has been a journey. I started out as a business analyst intern at an electronic company learning about accounting and IT consumer research. I then spent a summer at the University of Florida doing statistical analysis on a drone image mapping project. I also had a data analyst intern set up, but the COVID pandemic suspended the opportunity. Lucky enough, I met a group of peers in my undergrad who introduced me to the field of quantitative finance. We created the UR Quantitative Finance club on campus in which we held guest speaking seminars, mock trading sessions, and created an open space to discuss on the field. This led me to pursue a career a quantitative finance and now I am anticipating an internship as a quant risk analyst this upcomming summer.
